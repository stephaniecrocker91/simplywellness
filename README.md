<li>Aria-labels on the social media links, to make it user friendly and accesible.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Home Page - <em>index.html</em></h3>
<p>The homepage consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image that clearly displays the theme of the webiste, and conveys a sense of peace, harmony and balance. The colors are cool and calming, and match the color palette of the site. </li>
<li>A header just below the navigation bar that clearly explains the purpose of the site: Workplace Wellbeing & Mental health. It's colors contrast the header.</li>

<li>Home page is minimalistic, clear and concise.</li>

</ul>
<br>

<h3>Our Services Page - <em>ourservices.html</em></h3>
<p> Our services section is set up on another HTML page. It's aim is to describe in detail the services we provide. It is structured as follows:
<ul>
<li><u>A header:</u> "Our Bespoke Packages", which clearly describes what we offer.</li>
<li><u>A sub-header:</u> lists the specific services we offer: Meditation, Yoga, Pilates, Hiit and Nutrition. Each service listed hyperlinks to the section of the page with a more detailed description of that particular service. </li>
<li><u>A small paragraph:</u> in a white box detailing how the service packages.</li>
<li>This first section has an image-background that is easy on the eye, subtle and allows the text over it to be easily read.</li>
</ul>
Each one of the hyperlinks at the top of this page take the user to a sub-section containing:
<ul>
<li><u>A header:</u> with the service name (E.g: YOGA). The background color is dusty pink, and the font is uppercase. It makes for a clear distinction between the different services sections.</li>
<li><u>An image:</u> that portrays the service to the user. </li>
<li><u>A few paragraphs:</u> about the service and it's benefits. On small screens (mobile and some tablets) the paragraph is directly below the image. On larger displays, the paragraphs are to the right of the image.</li>

<h3>Colors</h3>
<hr>
<img src="assets/images/collage.png" width="400px">
<p>This was the image that inspired the colors for my webisite. I picked warm, earthy tones that contribute to the sites purpose. I added a few greens in the images, to give it more vibrancy.</p>
<p>In picked the following colors to be used as font color and background-color throughout the site. </p>
<img src="assets/images/palette.png" width="400px">

<h3>Typography</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>I initially wanted to combine <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Infant" target="_blank">Cormorant Infant</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Julius+Sans+One" target="_blank">Julius Sans One </a> (for headers mostly), but after testing I preferred keeping it all <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Infant" target="_blank">Cormorant Infant</a></li>
<li>Cormorant Infant: minimalistic style which portrays harmony, lightness, space and balance.</li>
<li><u>Letter-spacing:</u> To create more sense of space I added 1px letter spacing as default body styling, and and 4px for the headers.</li>
<li><u>Font-style:</u> I played around with Uppercase styling (for headers) and Italics (for some paragraphs) to give it more fluidity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Images and Icons</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>I chose an initial image as inspiration (Hero image displayed under Colors section), and from there chose other similar images. All the images have the same earthy tones, with a few pops of green. They are minimalistic, and convey the purpose of the website. It was important to use images for every service description section, so as to give visual aid of the service provided. These images were sourced by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank">Pexels.</a></li>
<li>I used instantly recognisable <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> icons for the social media links in the footer. These immediately stand out to the user. I styled them with the colors of the website and fixed them to the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>I couldn't get my first style.css stylesheet to link up to my HTML. I tried solving it for a while, and then created another style2.css file. This one seemed to connect, so I deleted the initial one and replaced with the second.</p>
<p>Corrected syntax for labels in contact form. From : "label for pilates" ---> wrong syntax. should be for="pilates" (pilates being the id of the checkbox it applies to). Jo from Student Support flagged this for me.</p>
